- The physics are unrealistic and inconsistent, making the cars hard to control and prone to flipping over or exploding for no reason.
- The damage model is poor and does not reflect the impact of the collisions. The cars do not deform or crumple as they should, and sometimes they even repair themselves mid-race.
- The soundtrack is annoying and repetitive, featuring generic rock and metal songs that do not fit the mood of the game.
- The maps are poorly designed and cluttered with obstacles that often block your view or send you flying off the track. The tracks are also too long and boring, lacking any sense of variety or challenge.

These are some of the reasons why FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction has a Metascore of 23 out of 100[^2^] and a user score of 2.9 out of 10[^2^] on Metacritic. Many fans of the FlatOut series have expressed their disappointment and frustration with this game on Steam forums[^3^] [^4^] and other platforms. They claim that FlatOut 3 has ruined the formula that made the previous games fun and exciting.
 
Therefore, if you are looking for a quality racing game that offers realistic physics, satisfying destruction, and diverse gameplay modes, you might want to look elsewhere. FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction demo might give you some moments of fun and thrill, but it might also leave you feeling frustrated and bored. You have been warned.
