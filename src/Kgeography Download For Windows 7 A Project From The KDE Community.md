After downloading the file, you will need to extract it using a program that can handle .tar.xz files, such as 7-Zip or WinRAR. You will get a folder named kgeography-4.14.0. Inside this folder, you will find a file named CMakeLists.txt. This is the file that contains the instructions for building KGeography from source code.
 
To build KGeography from source code, you will need to use CMake, a cross-platform tool that generates build files for various compilers and IDEs. You can download CMake from [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/). Follow the instructions on the website to install CMake on your computer.

 `cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\kgeography-4.14.0` 
Then, you will need to create a build folder inside the KGeography folder and navigate to it. For example, you can type the following commands:
 `mkdir build` `cd build` 
Next, you will need to run CMake to generate the build files for KGeography. You will need to specify the path to your KDE installation and the compiler that you want to use. For example, if you installed KDE in C:\KDE and you want to use Visual Studio 2019 as your compiler, you can type the following command:
 `cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\KDE ..` 
This command will create a Visual Studio solution file named KGeography.sln in the build folder. You can open this file with Visual Studio and build KGeography from there.
 
Alternatively, you can also build KGeography from the command prompt using MSBuild, a tool that comes with Visual Studio. To do this, you will need to navigate to the build folder and type the following command:
 `msbuild KGeography.sln /p:Configuration=Release` 
This command will build KGeography in release mode and create an executable file named kgeography.exe in the build\bin folder.
 
To install KGeography on your computer, you will need to copy the kgeography.exe file and the data folder from the build folder to your KDE installation folder. For example, if you installed KDE in C:\KDE, you will need to copy them to C:\KDE\bin and C:\KDE\share respectively.
 
Now you can run KGeography by
