Another feature of Oxygen Forensic Suite is that it can recover deleted data from the phone. This can be useful for forensic investigators who want to find evidence that was intentionally or accidentally erased by the user. The software can scan the phone memory and display the recovered data in a separate section of the GUI. The screenshot below shows some of the deleted messages that were recovered by Oxygen Forensic Suite.
  
Oxygen Forensic Suite can also perform cloud extraction and analysis. This means that it can access and download data from various cloud services that are linked to the phone, such as Google, Apple, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. The user needs to provide the credentials or tokens for the cloud accounts in order to perform the extraction. The software can then parse and display the cloud data in the same way as the phone data. The screenshot below shows some of the cloud services that were extracted by Oxygen Forensic Suite.
  
Oxygen Forensic Suite can also perform timeline analysis. This means that it can create a chronological visualization of the phone and cloud data, showing the events and activities that occurred on the phone or online. The user can customize the timeline by selecting the data types, sources, and time range that they want to see. The software can also highlight the anomalies and gaps in the timeline that might indicate tampering or manipulation. The screenshot below shows an example of a timeline created by Oxygen Forensic Suite.
  
Oxygen Forensic Suite can also perform social graph analysis. This means that it can create a network visualization of the phone and cloud contacts, showing the relationships and interactions between them. The user can explore the social graph by selecting the contacts, data types, and time range that they want to see. The software can also identify the key players and influencers in the network, as well as the common or isolated contacts. The screenshot below shows an example of a social graph created by Oxygen Forensic Suite.
  
Oxygen Forensic Suite can also perform geolocation analysis. This means that it can create a map visualization of the phone and cloud data, showing the locations and movements of the user and their contacts. The user can explore the map by selecting the data types, sources, and time range that they want to see. The software can also calculate the distance and speed between the locations, as well as the frequency and duration of the visits. The screenshot below shows an example of a map created by Oxygen Forensic Suite.
  
Oxygen Forensic Suite can also perform keyword search and analysis. This means that it can search for specific words or phrases in the phone and cloud data, showing the matches and their context. The user can enter the keywords manually or use predefined lists or regular expressions. The software can also filter the results by data type, source, date, etc. The screenshot below shows an example of a keyword search performed by Oxygen Forensic Suite.
