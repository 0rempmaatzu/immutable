- Open your audio editing software and load your audio project.
- Go to the mixer window and locate the master audio bus. It should be labeled as "Master" or "Output".
- Click on the FX button on the master audio bus to open the effects window.
- Click on the Add button and select Sony Wave Hammer Plugin 13 from the list of available plugins.
- Click on OK to load the plugin on the master audio bus.

## Step 2: Adjust the compressor settings
 
The compressor settings can help you control the dynamic range of your audio, which is the difference between the loudest and quietest parts. A lower dynamic range can make your audio more consistent and balanced, while a higher dynamic range can make your audio more expressive and natural. To adjust the compressor settings, follow these steps:

- Click on the Compressor tab on Sony Wave Hammer Plugin 13 to access the compressor settings.
- Adjust the Threshold slider to set the level at which the compressor starts to reduce the volume of your audio. A lower threshold means more compression, while a higher threshold means less compression.
- Adjust the Ratio slider to set how much compression is applied to your audio. A higher ratio means more compression, while a lower ratio means less compression.
- Adjust the Attack slider to set how fast the compressor reacts to changes in volume. A faster attack means more responsive compression, while a slower attack means smoother compression.
- Adjust the Release slider to set how fast the compressor returns to normal after reducing the volume. A faster release means quicker recovery, while a slower release means longer recovery.
- Adjust the Output Gain slider to compensate for any volume loss caused by compression. A higher output gain means louder output, while a lower output gain means quieter output.

## Step 3: Adjust the maximizer settings
 
The maximizer settings can help you increase the loudness of your audio, which is how loud your audio sounds compared to other audio sources. A higher loudness can make your audio more impactful and clear, while a lower loudness can make your audio more subtle and soft. To adjust the maximizer settings, follow these steps:

- Click on the Maximizer tab on Sony Wave Hammer Plugin 13 to access the maximizer settings.
- Adjust the Threshold slider to set the level at which the maximizer starts to increase the volume of your audio. A lower threshold means more maximization, while a higher threshold means less maximization.
- Adjust the Ceiling slider to set the maximum level that your audio can reach after maximization. A lower ceiling means more headroom, while a higher ceiling means less headroom.
- Adjust the Release slider to set how fast the maximizer returns to normal after increasing the volume. A faster release means quicker recovery, while a slower release means longer recovery.
- Adjust the Output Gain slider to compensate for any volume boost caused by maximization. A higher output gain means louder output, while a lower output gain means quieter output.
